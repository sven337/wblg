Very short article today. Based on my own, very limited and not statistically very strong experience, I encourage you to avoid buying non-waterproof IP60 LED strips and favor IP65.

A picture speaks a thousand words:

I guess this "IP60" strip was destined to be an IP65 silicone-coated one, but failed quality control?

    $(document).ready(function() {
        $("a[href$='.jpg'],a[href$='.jpeg'],a[href$='.png'],a[href$='.gif']").attr('rel', 'gallery').fancybox();
    });
</script>
