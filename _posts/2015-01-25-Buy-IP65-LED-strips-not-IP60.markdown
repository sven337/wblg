Very short article today. Based on my own, very limited and not statistically very strong experience, I encourage you to avoid buying non-waterproof IP60 LED strips and favor IP65.

A picture speaks a thousand words:

I guess this "IP60" strip was destined to be an IP65 silicone-coated one, but failed quality control?

    });
</script>
