I have owned an Altec Lansing 2100 kit for more ten years. They've served me very well and I am fairly happy with the product. However, it uses a linear power supply and the transformer hums a bit at 50Hz. Since it's located inside the box of the subwoofer, that tends to make the subwoofer vibrate at 50Hz when the device is plugged in but turned off. And at night, you can hear it.
Also, the power supply can't possibly have good efficiency, so I thought it was time to upgrade it to the 21st century and use a switched-mode power supply.
